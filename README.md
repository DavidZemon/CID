CID
Computationaly Interrupted Dance

Independent study project completed by David Zemon and Anthony DiGuida.
Built for TI's ARM Cortex-M4F series of processors, specifically the LM4F232 evaluation board. (Minor tweaks necesssary to work with the Launchpad LM4F120.)

Based on accelerometer input through the ADC, musical notes will be created via SPI communication with a DAC and output to headphones or whatever your desired audio output source is.
